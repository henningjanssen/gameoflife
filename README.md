# Game of Life

An implementation of Conways Game of Life written in Python.
GUI might be a little slow.

Click on a cell to change its status (living/dead). Living cells are green.
Use "Start" and "Stop" in the menu-bar to start and stop the evolution.

To start the game simply run gameoflife.py in the src-dir.
